flickr-spellcheckr
##################
A command line utility to go and spell check the title and descriptions of
your photos on flickr.

Full docs are hosted on Read the Docs http://flickr-spellcheckr.readthedocs.org/


Installing
==========
pip should be enough to get it installed

    pip install flickr-spellcheckr


Windows Users
-------------
There does not appear to be a simple way to install pyenchant. Please go to
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyenchant/
and download the egg for your platform and Python version. From there an

    easy_install download.pychant.egg

should be enough to make pip happy.


Running
=======
The setup script creates a ``flickr-spellchekr`` command. Running that should
put you in the command prompt interface for flickr-spellcheckr. Online help is
available by typing help


Thanks
======
A shoutout to PyCon 2012, for introducing me to awesome tools. cmd.py is
pretty slick.
